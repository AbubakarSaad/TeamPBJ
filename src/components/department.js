                    <p> An operations department is responsible for running your business successfully. It has the ultimate accountability for profit and loss, and seeks to maximize return on investment for the shareholders. The members of this department are ultimately responsible for the success of your business, and as such, maintain considerable power in your company. While the operations department is responsible for the bottom line, it also oversees the other departments in your organization, as well as the development of your employees and customers. </p>
